## Credit Scoring Repository 
#### Overview 
This repository contains a complete workflow for building, evaluating, and deploying a credit scoring system. The system uses customer data to predict creditworthiness, enabling financial institutions to make data-driven lending decisions.


### Features
#### Data Preprocessing:

Handles missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
Scales and normalizes numerical features.

#### Modeling:

Includes machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting.
Supports hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

#### Evaluation:

Provides key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

#### Deployment:

Export model as .pkl or .h5 for integration into web or mobile applications.

### Structure
`data/:` Sample datasets for training and testing.
`Notebooks/:` Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.
`Scripts/: `Scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
`models/:` Saved models for deployment.
`docs/:` Documentation and reports.
